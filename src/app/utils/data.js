        "summary": "In the world of software engineering, significant efforts have long been dedicated to optimizing application speed and resource management. However, as we approach the peak of the exponential curve of performance improvements and move away from the sole focus on building the most resource-optimized applications, priorities are shifting towards the way we interact with our digital devices. \n Many of the applications we use and love today are incredibly well-designed; however, beyond aesthetics and layout, most of them, outside of products with large teams, lack a vital human element: usability. This open source project, which aims to document the journey of mastering interaction-driven UI design in React applications, serves as a valuable, free educational resource for those eager to infuse life and dynamism into their software creations. Join me as we explore the exciting future of user interfacesâ€”one driven by user-first interactive experiences.",

        "summary": "In my professional career working in real estate, I was continually educated about the opportunities and financial prosperity that real estate ownership contributes to the American economy. However, while real estate investment offers significant upside potential, it also carries substantial downside risks if proper research and considerations aren't undertaken at the outset. \nTo address this issue, I have developed an application designed to empower aspiring real estate investors with the necessary data and financial calculations to approach residential real estate investments with confidence. This application leverages for-sale property data and utilizes a cash flow analysis financial model to help investors pinpoint the best investment opportunities within their financial means. It's a practical tool to guide your real estate investment journey effectively.",
